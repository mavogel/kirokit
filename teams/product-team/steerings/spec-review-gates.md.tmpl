# Spec review gates

When you write a spec (`requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`), each phase is reviewed by the role that owns it before the next phase starts. Use the `subagent` tool for each review, wait for its answer, and fold it in.

## After requirements

Ask the `product-owner` agent to review `requirements.md` for:

- **Vision fit:** does it serve the product's goal and the user named in it?
- **Completeness:** are every user, state and error case covered?
- **Acceptance criteria:** can a tester check each one (WHEN ... THEN ...)?
- **Prioritisation:** is each requirement marked must, should or could?

Change `requirements.md` for every gap it names, or say why you keep it, before you start `design.md`.

## After design

Ask the `engineer` agent to review `design.md` for:

- **Deep modules:** simple interfaces that hide a lot of behaviour, not shallow pass-through layers.
- **Information hiding:** internals stay behind the interface; a change stays inside one module.
- **Red flags:** special cases a better abstraction would remove, names that do not say what a thing is, a change that ripples across many modules.

Change `design.md` for every red flag it names, or say why you keep it, before you write `tasks.md`.

## Other roles

The `qa`, `ux-designer` and `customer` agents review on request: ask them when the person does, or when a requirement depends on how something fails, looks or feels.

If you are the reviewing agent yourself, review the file directly instead of calling yourself.
